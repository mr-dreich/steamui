I get annoyed every time I open Steam on Mac or Linux and it runs like crap compared to Windows. So I took a crack at recreating Steam using Godot and GodotSteam by Gramps.

This is a SUPER wip and by no means functional other than connecting to steam, loading games/icons/headers, loading friends and such. You can't install any games or browse anything other than your library, I will not be continuing this.
